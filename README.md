Pymongo updating and inserting
This project first used Selenium to acces top-8 most expensive Bored Apes from “[The] Bored Ape Yacht Club […]which is a non-fungible token (NFT) collection built on the Ethereum blockchain
Then, the code extracts attributes of each Ape and stores the extracted data in a document inside a mongoDB collection
